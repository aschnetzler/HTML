<p> Hello, My name is Alexa Schnetzler. I am currently a Senior at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. My major is
Information Systems  Technology which can be abbreviated as IST. When I graduate I hope to get a job in Web-Development. I have been on the dean's list 
three years in a row. I currently work at Bandana's BBQ Resturaunt as a host. I have previously worked at Kroger as a cashier which gave me 6 months
of retail experience. I am interested in Netflix and video games. This is what I can be found doing when I am not doing school work or working.</p>
